Icons can help users understand actions and information, and give attention to elements.

## Usage

### Types

Icons can be interactive or static.

Interactive icons can be used either alone or combined with text. For example a trashcan icon for deleting content, or a heart to add to favorites.

Static icons are only used combined with text, and are not clickable. For example an icon of a speedometer next to the information about mileage in the car ad. A non clickable icon without any other information does not give much value. This type of icon is more like an illustration. You might also consider using illustration style.

### Best practices

Follow conventions when it comes to how interactive icons look. For example, an upload icon looks about the same everywhere, making the user understand this is an action to upload something.

## Do's and don'ts

- Do show that an interactive icon is clickable, using hover and focus states.
- Don't use icons on everything, as this will make it harder to scan the page, and increase cognitive load.
- Don't use our brand color Secondary Blue on an interactive icon unless it has a label. This color does not reach the accessibility standards on white background.

## Styling

- Don't resize the icon, use the default sizes from the icon library to make FINN look more consistent.
- Icon set and size is the same on all platforms and screen sizes. There are some differences in the icon set depending on which platform (for example the native share icon for apps).
- Our standard icons are 24x24px, and we have some mini icons of 16x16px.
- We can use bigger icons, more used as an illustrative element. For example the market icons on the front page.

Illustrations are used to communicate content in a visual way, or describe user journeys.

## Usage

You can use illustrations to enhance a topic or a message. They make it easier for the user to know what the content is about, without reading the text.

For example, if you have a page with information about the process of buying something, you can use an illustration of a credit card or cash on the paragraph about payment.

It can break up walls of text, and make the content more appealing.

### Types

Illustrations can be of people and things, but also of parts of our product. For example, an illustration of the favorite functionality to visualize where they can find the heart, or an illustration of an ad.

### Principles

Illustrations make the user feel like the content is easy to consume.

**On brand**

They should enhance the values of our brand; smart, funny, and safe.

**We live now**

Keep illustrations up to date. People recognize a smartphone! You don't have to use an illustration of the old phone with a wire anymore.

**Playful**

Have fun with illustrations! Mix parts from different illustrations to create new ones that fit your context. How about making an animation?

### Best practices

- Illustrations capture attention, so make sure they are not distracting the user
- Overkill use of illustrations can be overwhelming
- Use illustrations to break up a text heavy screen

## Styling

- Be consistent. Use our established illustration style to ensure that all illustrations are part of the same family. Divergence from this will make our brand less consistent.
- Don't make complex illustrations with too much detail. Communication is key, so any unnecessary details only detract from the point you are trying to illustrate.
- Use size and composition to add emphasis. For example, make the phone in the girl's hand a bit bigger if the supporting text is about phones.
- Use the illustration color palette.

## Content guidelines

We don't use text in illustrations in our product. Onomatopoetikons are fine. If you have to use text combined with an illustration, try to have actual, real text. Coded text. Not text from a png or svg. This is because the screen readers have to be able to read the text.

## Do’s and don'ts

#### Do

- If you use illustrations of people, remember diversity
- Follow our illustration style

#### Don’t

- Don't use illustrations as clickable actions
- Place random illustrations in random places just because you think the page needs an illustration

In some cases it might be more fitting with a style that looks more like static icons. [Check out our guidelines for icons](https://finnivers.now.sh/guidelines/Icons/Guidelines/).

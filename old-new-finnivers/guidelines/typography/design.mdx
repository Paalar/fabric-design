Typography is how you use text to create visual hierarchy. Good typography can make content easier to read and help the user scan the page to find the information they need.

Other methods for creating a good visual hierarchy is the use of white space and colors.

## Usage

### Principles

**Logical** <br/>
Follow semantic markup, and use CSS for styling.

**Scannable** <br/>
Choose size and weight of the text based on what information the user needs to see.

**Readable** <br/>
Use language that is easy to understand, and follow best practices below for text blocks.

### Best practices

Some tips to make your text comfortable to read:

- _Avoid long lines_, don't use the entire screen width. Long lines makes it difficult to read, and difficult to find the correct line again on the next line break. Too narrow lines makes the eyes jump back and forth too much.

- _Avoid walls of text_. Divide text into paragraphs and include headings, white space, and illustrations if you have to.

- _Left align text blocks_. It is more difficult to read blocks of text which is centered or right aligned, since the eyes would jump back and forth withouth having a consistent point to go back to on the next line.

## Sizes

Headings should semantically follow h1-h6 tags, and default text tags are a-tags and p-tags. Use classes on titles to change the size of the headings.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Usage</th>
      <th>Weight</th>
      <th>Class</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h1 class="u-t1 u-no-break">Title 1</h1>
      </td>
      <td>
        This style should only be used once for each screen, and this is the
        first text element that catches the users attention. It gives the user
        an overview of which page he or she is located on. Should not be used
        for long sentences or text blocks.
      </td>
      <td>Always use Medium weight.</td>
      <td>.u-t1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h2 class="u-t2 u-no-break">Title 2</h2>
      </td>
      <td>
        Make sure to have a lot of space between Title2 sections to distinguish
        content.
      </td>
      <td>Always Medium weight.</td>
      <td>.u-t2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h3 class="u-t3 u-no-break">Title 3</h3>
      </td>
      <td>Used as sub level to Title2.</td>
      <td>
        Always Medium weight when used as a title. If used as a lead paragraph
        it can be Light.
      </td>
      <td>.u-t3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p class="u-b1 u-no-break">Body</p>
      </td>
      <td>Is used for main text blocks.</td>
      <td>
        Use light weight for text blocks, and Medium if it is used as a label,
        heading or to emphasize something.
      </td>
      <td>.u-b1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p class="u-caption u-no-break">Caption</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        Used for short amount of text if neither Body or Detail is appropriate.
      </td>
      <td>
        Use light weight for text blocks, and Medium if it is used as a label,
        heading or to emphasize something.
      </td>
      <td class="u-no-break">.u-caption</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p class="u-d1 u-no-break">Detail</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        Used for less important information, not for blocks of text. The color
        Stone is prefered in most cases with white background. For colored
        background such as ribbons, the color should be Licorice.
      </td>
      <td>
        Font weight for this style should be Regular to make it more readable
        for the small size. Can also use Bold for labels.
      </td>
      <td>.u-d1</td>

      <th>Class</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td>Never breaks even with whitespace.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>.u-truncate</td>

        Cuts the text when it is longer than the width of the parent element
        (ellipsis).

## Why do we have PuseFINN?

Because it is useful to have a character that ties together all the different things we do in various parts of FINN. FINN reise and FINN torget have very little in common - PuseFINN makes it possible to talk about both services and still be perceived as a whole. He is our blue line!

FINN must be smart, funny, and safe. PuseFINN is one of the tools we have to strengthen our brand value, fun. For example, if we wanted to talk to users about more serious issues, e.g. safe transactions - this is probably not the time to use puseFINN.

## Usage

To avoid overexposure, PuseFINN should not be used in the service itself. We think it is foolish to introduce a mascot into the otherwise modern and clean design. Exceptions are error pages, where we want to cheer up the user. PuseFINN should always be used as a photo, never as an illustration.

### Principles

An easy way to summarize puseFINN is:

When I use FINN I want smartness and safety.

When I am told about FINN I want to be entertained.

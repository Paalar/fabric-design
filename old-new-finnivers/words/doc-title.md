## General Guidelines

### Do's

The goal of the HTML title tag is to provide users with a human-friendly reference to the page, indicating what content or purpose that the page serves.
In other words, it should be possible for users to identify the content/purpose of a page by reading its document title.
This goal is also what search engine algorithms value because it ultimately results in users knowing what they go to.

### Don'ts

Having a comma-separated list of keywords in the title is bad because it indicates that the page has mixed content or serves multiple purposes, which puts cognitive stress on users.
Search engines prefer not to redirect their users to pages that may give them a bad experience, and cognitive stress can be bad even for people who don't have cognitive disabilities.
If you feel like a page needs multiple keywords then that is a sign that the page itself should be split into multiple pages, so that each page will be more straight to the point.
[Arngren.net](http://arngren.net/) is a great example of how it should NOT be done.

## Market Frontpages

The HTML title on a market frontpage should start with the market name, optionally followed by a hyphen (-) and a slogan/phrase associated with the market.

### Examples:

- Torget - FINN.no - slogan
- Lån og forsikring til bil - FINN økononi
- Billige flybilletter - FINN reise
- Billige hotell - FINN reise

## Subpages

The HTML title on a subpage should start with the title/name of the object, followed by a vertical bar (|) and a market name if the object belongs to a particular market.

### Examples:

- Fly fra Oslo til London | FINN reise
- Til salgs | FINN torget
- Norges største kosedyr | FINN torget
- Søk om boliglån | FINN økonomi
- Meldinger
- Min FINN

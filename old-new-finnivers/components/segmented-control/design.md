title: Segmented control
---

<p class="u-d1">Updated on 4 May 2020 by Adi Dick</p>

A segmented control is used to help users choose from a number of options. It’s a horizontal control made up of multiple segments that are equal in width. Users select one of the segments to see the related content and tasks organised there.

Like buttons, segments can contain text or images. They work in a similar way to a group of radio buttons in that only one button, or in this case segment, can be active at a time. Screen readers will also present them as radio buttons. Segmented controls are often used to display different views of a set of data. In Maps, for example, a segmented control lets you switch between Map, Transit, and Satellite views.

## Usage

Use segmented buttons when presenting users with a group of mutually exclusive options. A segmented control is broken into segments, and each one can be toggled on or off. The first button in the group is always selected and represents the default option. Users can select only one button at a time. Use a segmented control only when the options are predefined and are at most 4 options.

### Principles

**Less is more**<br />
Limit the number of segments to improve usability. Wider segments are easier to tap on.

**Visually balanced**<br />
Try to keep segment content size consistent. Because all segments have equal width, it doesn’t look great if content fills some segments but not others.

**Short and sweet**<br />
Keep the text short and to the point. The controls should be simple to understand and use at a glance.

**Consistent**<br />
Avoid mixing text and images in a segmented control. Keep it simple by using either text or images (icons), not both.

### Best practices

Keep it short (1-2 words), to help make sure that the control fits on smaller screens.

## Styling

Segmented controls use the same styling as “default” action buttons. Unlike normal action buttons, segmented controls have an “active” state to show when one of the segments has been selected.

## Content guidelines

Use short and descriptive text that describes a view or object.
Use sentence case. It’s OK to use title case for proper nouns (Ola Nordmann), branded products (Adobe Photoshop), and official things like World Health Organization.
Don’t use punctuation.
If the segmented controls contain text, you don’t need to label the entire control.

## Do’s and don'ts

**Do**

- Limit the number of segments to improve usability. Wider segments are easier to click/tap.
- Try to keep segment content size consistent within the component.

**Dont**

- Don’t use a segmented control for action, such as add and remove.
- Don't use segmented control when the information under each segment is not related.

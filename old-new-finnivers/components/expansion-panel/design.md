Use for a basic “show more” interaction when you need to display more content.

The expansion panel component should:
Be used for information that is lower priority or that user’s don’t need to see all the time
Not be used to hide error messages or other critical information that requires an immediate action

## Content guidelines

Expansion panels are clickable panels with expandable and collapsible functionality. It has the same characteristics as other clickable elements, such as buttons and cards, which have interactive states.

### Principles

### Best practices

The collapsible component should:

- Be used for information that is lower priority or that user’s don’t need to see all the time
- Not be used to hide error messages or other critical information that requires an immediate action

Buttons allow users to take action, and make choices, with a single tap.

Buttons are used to initiate an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience, and are therefore used primarily on actionable items. They express what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it.

Some examples include Add, Save, Delete, and Sign up. Each page can have one or two primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons.

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Usage

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Dialogs
- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

## Principles

**Identifiable**<br />
Buttons should indicate that they can trigger an action.

**Findable**<br />
Buttons should be easy to find among other elements, including other buttons.

**Clear**<br />
A button’s action and state should be clear.

**Logical**<br />
Place the button where it makes sense. It should follow the page flow, and be close to corresponding interaction.

## Hierarchy and placement

### Hierarchy

What should be the call to action? Everything can not be equally important on a page. Find the key feature, consider the importance of the action and finally select the most suitable button.

### Placement

### Styling

Icons should be used only on Toggle buttons and add / show more buttons.
Font weight Medium is used inside all buttons.

### Button link and text

Describe what will happen when triggered.
Short text. Preferably one to three words and never go over two lines.
Use verbs in the imperative, such as "Buy".
Use verb + noun when you have two words, like "Send message".
Links should tell clearly what kind of information the user receives.
Generic text used several places in one page confuses the user. Do all links link to the same place?

### Button groups

Only two buttons shall appear together. Many buttons appearing in groups increases cognitive load. It will be too much to deal with at once for the user. Remember, more choice does not make it easier to choose.

When several options related to each other are grouped together, consider using radio buttons and use a button to trigger the action instead.

There can be more buttons on a page, but make sure to emphasize hierarchy by using different types of buttons.

## Button types

### CTA (Call-to-action)

```jsx react-live=true
<CallToActionButton>Send melding</CallToActionButton>
```

Because our Action colour demands attention, only use one Call-to-action button on each page. This helps direct the user to the single most important action on the page.

When several actions on a page are needed, use default or flat buttons.

### Default button

```jsx react-live=true
<Button>Søk</Button>
```

Default buttons are what we use to initiate secondary actions, e.g. cancel, upload image, search. Default buttons are often placed next to the CTA button.

When using two buttons that are equally weighted, use default buttons, or flat buttons.

### Flat button

Flat buttons (not to be confused with links) trigger tertiary actions. They have the same padding rules as CTA/Default buttons but with a transparent background and frame. These can be used alongside the primary button, to make the primary action stand out more, or in cases where space is limited.

Flat buttons have the same padding rules as the other buttons but differ in that they have an invisible background and frame. Not to be confused with links , flat buttons are heavier and use a medium weight font.

### Destructive

```jsx react-live=true
<DestructiveButton>Slett</DestructiveButton>
```

The [CTA button](#call-to-action) is replaced with the destructive button in destructive actions, like "delete". A destructive button and CTA should never appear on the same screen!

The destructive button can also exist in the form of a flat button when space is limited.

### Links

Links are used for navigation to a new context on another page. They can be used in text blocks or standalone. Link color must stand out from the text color so the visually impaired and colorblind can distinguish links from regular text.

In the apps links should never appear inside a text block, but appear below the text.

### Buttons with icons

Buttons can have an icon. For example in flat buttons.

Add information
Show hidden content

### Toggle buttons

You can use toggle buttons to turn something on or off. It can contain an icon to clarify status. For example follow and unfollow.

Toggle buttons can be icon only, but the different states must be clear to the user. For example you can add favourites by clicking the heart. When not favorited the heart is empty. When favorited the heart is filled.

### Button sizes

**Default**<br />
Buttons, input fields and dropdown menus are styled with the same padding. Touch device buttons have slightly increased padding on top and bottom.

**Small**<br />
Should only appear in lists with associated text that give context. Padding and font size is smaller (detail text). Only use one primary button for each list item. This makes it possible to have more primary actions on one page.

### Segmented control

Styled similar to buttons, but works as tabs or radio buttons.

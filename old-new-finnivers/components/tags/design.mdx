Tags are used to show input the user have selected or searched for. Selected tags contain a "remove" icon. Selected and suggested tags should look different. Suggested tags should be less emphasized.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Tags are appropriate when there are a lot of different types of input to choose from,
or when we don't have all the options on FINN. If we know the options, or there are
not too many options, we can use checkboxes instead.

For example, we can use tags together with an input field where the user would enter terms to make the ad more searchable. Suggested tags would be below the input field, while the selected would be above or inside the field. Or, you can use tags as a way of displaying which filters you have selected.

Tags are rounded to get a larger tappable area, unless you need to get many tags into a very small space, like on the filter in the apps. There they are squared with less padding, with a small corner radius.

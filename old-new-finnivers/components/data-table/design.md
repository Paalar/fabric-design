Data tables are used to organize and display information from a data set in grid-like format of rows and columns. They make a larger volume of data easier to scan, read and understand, and are ideal for text based content.

Data tables can contain:

- Interactive components (such as links, buttons, or menus)
- Non-interactive elements (such as badges)
- Tools to query and manipulate data

## Usage

Data tables are used when there is a need for collecting, comparing and analysing collections of data.

### Principles

**Organized**<br />
Data tables should organize content in a meaningful way, such as using hierarchy or alphabetization.

**Interactive**<br />
Data tables should allow user interaction, so that users can customize how data is displayed or interacted with.

**Intuitive**<br />
Data tables should be easy to use, with a logical structure that makes content easy to understand.

## Best practices

Data tables should:

- Show values across multiple categories and measures.
- Allow for filtering and ordering when comparison is not a priority.
- Help users visualize and scan many values from an entire data set.
- Help users find other values in the data hierarchy through use of links.
- Minimize clutter by only including values that support the data’s purpose.
- Include a summary row to show the column totals.
- Not include calculations within the summary row.
- Wrap instead of truncate content. This is because if row titles start with the same word, they’ll all appear the same when truncated.
- Tables should be used when presenting three or more columns of information.

### Alignment

The following rules should be applied to the contents of data tables:

- Numerical = Right aligned
- Textual data = Left aligned
- Align headers with their related data
- Don’t center align

### Types

This should give a full overview of all of the various types of [component], allowing the user to understand how the various types hang together as a family.

## Anatomy

Data tables contain a header row at the top that has column names with rows of data below.

Data tables organize information across:

- Columns
- Column header names
- Rows
- Footers
- Pagination

## Content guidelines

Headers should:

- Be informative and descriptive
- Concise and scannable
- Include units of measurement symbols so they aren’t repeated throughout the columns
- Use sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)

Column content should:

- Be concise and scannable
- Not include units of measurement symbols (put those symbols in the headers)
  -Use sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)

### Decimals

Keep decimals consistent. For example, don’t use 3 decimals in one row and 2 in others.

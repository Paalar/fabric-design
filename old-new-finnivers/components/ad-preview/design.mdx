title: Ad preview
---

The component shows a small preview of an ad, containing the most relevant information in the spesific context. That means the ad can display different types of data depending on where it is located. For example, in the result page it is not necessary to show which market the ad belongs to, but this can be more relevant in the list of favorites.

## Usage

### Principles

**Keep it short**

- What is enough? Don't overwhelm users with information. Do you really need to repeat something that is already in the filter?

**Preview with purpose**

- Choose the type of view based on the purpose of the page. In the result page you can have both list and grid view, since it can be used for both inspiration, and to compare important information.

**Concistency**

- Same type of actions and information should be shown at the same location in the same type of list. For example, location is always top left and the favourite button is always top right. This way people always know where to find the spesific information.

### Types

**List view**

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Anatomy</th>
      <th>Hierarchy</th>
      <th>Suitable for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Shows a small thumbnail to the left, with the information located to the
        right.
      </td>
      <td>The text is the main focus, while the image is secondary.</td>
      <td>
        Comparing information, decision making and searching for specific items.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br />

**Grid view**

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Anatomy</th>
      <th>Hierarchy</th>
      <th>Suitable for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Shows a big image, with the information located below the image.</td>
      <td>The image is the main focus, while the text is secondary.</td>
      <td>Exploration and inspiration.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For mobile devices, we can also choose to show only one ad horisontally, instead of several. We usually call that _card view_, and it follows the same principles as grid view.

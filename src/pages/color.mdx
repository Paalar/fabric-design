# Colors and color usage

- Use colors to give elements attention from the user - this helps the user finish their task.
- Don't have many colors that will compete for attention.
- Do not use color with negative assosiation to communicate something positive, or the other way around.
- Follow our guidelines for color combinations to make sure your design is accessible for those with poor sight. We are required by the Norwegian Law to be accessible.

# Typography

Typography is how you use text to create visual hierarchy. Good typography can make content easier to read and help the user scan the page to find the information they need.

## Guidelines

### Don't use underlines for adding emphasis

Underlines makes the text look like links. They should not be used as a way for adding emphasis to words.

### Avoid walls of text

Keep paragraphs concise. Some users with cognitive disabilities (and even those who donâ€™t) can have a very difficult time reading and comprehending large blocks of text.
Divide text into paragraphs and include headings, white space, and illustrations if you have to.

### Left align text

It is more difficult to read blocks of text which is centered or right aligned, since the eyes would jump back and forth withouth having a consistent point to go back to on the next line.

### Don't let paragraphs get too thin

Paragraphs of text that are too thin are difficult to read, as the eyes jump back and forth too much. If the paragraph texts are too long, it is difficult to locate the next line. Ideally, block of text should be 70 characters wide.

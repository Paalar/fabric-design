# Button

Buttons allow users to perform an action. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to improtant actions users need to do in order to move forward in a flow.

## Options

### Label

All buttons require a label for accessibility.

### Primary CTA

The primary call to action button communicates strong emphasis and is reserved for actions that are essential to an experience. There should only be one visible call to action button per page. There is no flat style for this button because it is meant to be the most prominent element on the page.

### Secondary

The secondary button is for low emphasis. It is meant to be paired with other button types to surface less prominent actions. On pages where there are more than one important action, multiple secondary buttons can be used. If two buttons are equally weighted, both should be secondary buttons (or flat buttons).

### Flat

By default, buttons have a visible stroke and fill. Flat buttons do not have this visible stroke or fill and should only be used for secondary actions within a button group. Flat buttons have the same padding rules as other action buttons and reveal a button-like background color when hovered.

### Destructive variant

The destructive button is for emphasizing actions that can be destructive or have negative consequences if taken. It replaces the primary CTA button in these destructive situations and should be used sparingly. A destructive button and a primary CTA should never appear on the same screen. The destructive button can also exist as a flat button variant in cases where the consequence of the action is still destructive, but less critical.

### Icon

Icons can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required. Icons should not be used for decoration. Only 16x16px sized icons should be used in buttons.

### Size

Buttons come in two different sizes: defaault, and small. The default size is the most frequently used option, with the small variant being used when space is limited, or in cases where there are multiple buttons on a page and the default size becomes too overwhelming. When using buttons it's important to ensure you maintain a good visual hierachy on the page.

### Disabled

As a rule, we try to avoid using disabled buttons, instead we try to communicate what is or isn't possible by other means, to avoid confusion when a user tries to interact with it. A button in a disabled state shows that an action exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This state can be used to maintain layout continuity and to communicate that an action may become available later. Use only as a last resort!

### Loading

To show the user that the action they triggered has begun, buttons have an in progress or loading state.

## Behaviors

### Keyboard focus

A button can be navigated using a keyboard. The keyboard focus state takes the button’s visual hover state and adds a blue outer-stroke to the button in focus.

### Flexible width

The width of a button automatically adjusts to fit the text. The default padding on each side of the button is set to 16px, with the only exception to the rule being when buttons are used as full-width on mobile or in other containers when a full-width button makes sense.

### Text overflow

When the button text is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps to form another line. Best practice is to avoid text wrapping in buttons where possible, so if your text wraps over two lines, consider making your text it shorter and more concise.

## Usage guidelines

### Be concise

Button text should be concise: 1 or 2 words, no longer than 4 words, with fewer than 20 characters including spaces. Don’t use punctuation marks such as periods or exclamation points, or other visual elemnts like emojis.

### Use clear text

Button texts should be clear about the outcome of the action. Most buttons should start with a verb. For example, use “Agree” instead of “Yes” in a dialog or use “Sign Up” instead of “Submit” in a form.

### Use sentence case

Button text should always be in sentence case. Capitalization should never be used to give more prominence to a specific button.

### Don't override color

Do not use custom colors for buttons. The colors of different button variations have been designed to be consistent and accessible across all design solutions.

### Use icons only when neccessary

Icons can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required and the icon is highly relevant to the action. Icons should not be used for decoration.

    Whenever possible, add an in-line action button if there's a way for a user to quickly address the issue associated with an alert.

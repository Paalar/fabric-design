# Slider

Sliders allow users to quickly select a value within a range. They should be used when the upper and lower bounds to the range are invariable.

### Example:Don't include periods in short phrases or single sentences

Do not include periods in alert banner messages that are short phrases or single sentences. This helps keep the text quicker to read and easier to parse.

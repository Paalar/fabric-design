## Options

### Label

Description lists should always include labels. In some exceptional cases it's okay not to use labels at all, if the output is self explanatory.

### Hierarchy

In description lists the output text is set to a strong weight to help give more focus to the information than the labels. In most cases this makes the specific information people are looking for easier to find.

## Usage guidelines

### No colon neccessary

Do not use colons ( : ) on labels, since the different styling of the label and output is enough to differentiate the text and adds unneccessary visual noise.

## Colors themes and modes
Fabric offers built in support for light/dark mode.  


### Target contrast ratio
All of the colors in Fabric color themes are generated by target contrast ratio. This maps certain greys and colors to meet WCAG AA accessability requirements for minimum contrast levels. 
( target 3:1 ratio from grey-100 for each theme to the midrange colors.   (ie dark mode gray-100 vs blue-500 and light mode gray-100 vs blue-500))

### Using the color system
Every part of the interface in any state (hover, disabled etc.) is mapped to one of the tints and shades defined in Fabric. Constraining the interface to a set number of colors ensures a high level of consistancy between projects and teams while also providing flexibility and context for use of color. It also ensures accessible contrast when colors are used correctly.

## Grays
Untinted/tinted greyscale

## Semantic colors
Semantic colors have assigned meanings and should be used consistantly throughout the site to set expectations of meaning for users. Color should be used sparingly and intentionally to reinforce hierarchies and to create clear modes of communication. Too much color can easily create cognitive overload, affecting users ability to efficiently interact with products.

## Static colors

- Use colors to give elements attention from the user - this helps the user finish their task.
- Don't have many colors that will compete for attention.
- Do not use color with negative assosiation to communicate something positive, or the other way around.
- Follow our guidelines for color combinations to make sure your design is accessible for those with poor sight. We are required by the Norwegian Law to be accessible.
